Nest
====

Generate nested namespaced keys for key-value databases.

Description
-----------

If you are familiar with databases like
[Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis) and
libraries like [Ohm](http://ohm.keyvalue.org) or
[redis-namespace](http://github.com/defunkt/redis-namespace), you
already know how important it is to craft the keys that will hold the
data.

    >> @redis.set "event:3:name", "Redis Meetup"
    >> @redis.get "event:3:name"
    => "Redis Meetup"

It is a design pattern in key-value databases to use the key to simulate
structure, and you can read more about this in the [case study for a
Twitter clone](http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/TwitterAlikeExample).

Nest helps you generate those keys by providing chainable namespaces:

    >> event = Nest.new("event")
    >> @redis.set event[3][:name], "Redis Meetup"
    >> @redis.get event[3][:name]
    => "Redis Meetup"

Usage
-----

To create a new namespace:

    >> ns = Nest.new("foo")
    => "foo"

    >> ns["bar"]
    => "foo:bar"

    >> ns["bar"]["baz"]["qux"]
    => "foo:bar:baz:qux"

And you can use any object as a key, not only strings:

    >> ns[:bar][42]
    => "foo:bar:42"

In a more realistic tone, lets assume you are working with Redis and
dealing with events:

    >> events = Nest.new("events")
    => "events"

    >> redis = Redis.new
    => #<Redis::Client...>

    >> id = redis.incr(event)
    => 1

    >> redis.set events[id][:name], "Redis Meetup"
    => "OK"

    >> redis.get events[id][:name]
    => "Redis Meetup"

    >> meetup = events[id]
    => "events:1"

    >> redis.get meetup[:name]
    => "Redis Meetup"

Using Nest as an object oriented Redis key
------------------------------------------

If you supply a Redis client as a second parameter, you can operate with
Redis directly:

    >> redis = Redis.new
    => #<Redis::Client...>

    >> events = Nest.new("events", redis)
    => "events"

    >> events.sadd(meetup)
    => true

    >> events.sismember(meetup)
    => true

    >> events.smembers
    => ["events:1"]

    >> events.del
    >> true

It allows you to execute all the Redis commands that expect a key as the
first parameter. Think of it as a curried Redis client.

Differences with redis-namespace
--------------------------------

[redis-namespace](http://github.com/defunkt/redis-namespace) wraps Redis
and translates the keys back and forth transparently.

Use redis-namespace when you want all your application keys to live in a
different scope.

Use Nest when you want to use the keys to represent structure.

Differences with Ohm
--------------------

[Ohm](http://ohm.keyvalue.org) lets you map Ruby objects to Redis with
little effort. It not only alleviates you from the pain of generating
keys for each object, but also helps you when dealing with references
between objects.

Use Ohm when you want to use Redis as your database.

Use Nest when mapping objects with Ohm is not possible.

Installation
------------

    $ sudo gem install nest
