This is a project generated by [Monk](http://monkrb.com).

 - It uses no database.
 - Some views were set up for you that use [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/)
   (for HTML) and [SASS / SCSS](http://sass-lang.com) (for CSS).

Settings
--------

Check the configuration file at `config/settings.rb`. The configured keys
can be accessed with the Sinatra helper `settings`.

Testing
-------

There's a user story in `test/stories/site_test.rb`. Start
adding tests and then run `monk test`. Testing is done
with [Cutest](http://github.com/djanowski/cutest) and
[Capybara](http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara).

Dependencies
------------

Monk is vendor friendly, and every library in `./vendor` is autom√°tically
added to the load path. It also ships with a `.gems` file that can be
imported with RVM.

In order to install the gems listed in the .gems manifest, run `monk
install`.

If you add gems to your gemset and want to update the `.gems` manifest,
simply run `monk lock`.
