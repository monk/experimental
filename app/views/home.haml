    =================

    This is a [Monk](http://monkrb.com) skeleton that
    uses [Redis](http://redis.io) as the database and
    [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) for the views. In addition,
    we use [SASS / SCSS](http://sass-lang.com) for CSS. This skeleton lives at
    [http://github.com/monk/experimental](http://github.com/monk/experimental).

    The page you are looking at was generated by `app/routes/site.rb`, and the
    template is located at `app/views/home.haml`.

    Settings
    --------

    Check the configuration file at `config/settings.rb`. The configured keys
    can be accessed with the Sinatra helper `settings`, and you will also find
    an example in this view and in the layout.

    Database
    --------

    Redis is connected to `#{@redis[:host]}:#{@redis[:port]}`. If you want to
    change it, you can change the `REDIS_URL` environment variable:

    `export REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6380/0`

    Testing
    -------

    There's a user story in `test/stories/site_test.rb`. Start
    adding tests and then run `monk test`. Testing is done
    with [Cutest](http://github.com/djanowski/cutest) and
    [Capybara](http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara).

    Dependencies
    ------------

    Monk is vendor friendly, and every library in `./vendor` is autom√°tically
    added to the load path. It also ships with a `.gems` file that can be
    imported with RVM.

    In order to install the gems listed in the .gems manifest, run `monk
    install`.

    If you add gems to your gemset and want to update the `.gems` manifest,
    simply run `monk lock`.
